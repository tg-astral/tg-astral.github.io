        <p><em>Why the fuck did I spend 18 hours straight making this</em></p>
        <h2 id='what-is-remos'>What is RemOS?</h2>
        <p>RemOS 2 is the <strong>pinnacle of Linux</strong>. It&#39;s a lightweight, fast system, and <strong>blessed by the presence of best girl herself.</strong></p>
        <p>It&#39;s based on Void Linux, with JWM as the window manager. Why JWM? God if I know, I literally picked a random one. Nonetheless, the UI is absolutely stunning, and fully rem-ified. It&#39;s got a couple quirks (I tried for a couple hours to get flashdrives to automatically mount before giving up), but it could theoretically be used as your daily driver if you don&#39;t value your sanity.</p>
        <p>RemOS 2 is a masochist OS, built for masochists by a masochist. But it&#39;s all worth it for best girl.</p>
        
        <h2 id='how-do-i-get-this-glorious-os-onto-my-machine'>How do I get this glorious OS onto my machine?</h2>
        <p>RemOS 2 is a spin of Void Linux, and as such the install process is identical to mainline Void. Download the iso <a href=#downloads>below</a>, then follow the <a href='https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/live-images/guide.html'>Void Installation Guide</a>. <strong>On the &quot;Source&quot; page, make sure to select Local, not Network</strong>.</p>

        <p>ufetch at idle (Note that the high RAM usage is because VirtualBox Guest Additions were running, prior to enabling them the idle usage was 204mb).</p>

        <p>PCManFM and Alacritty (The rem pixel art is a bit scuffed on HiDPI displays)</p>

        <p>Yes, it runs Minecraft (The 9 FPS was due to being in a VM, and even getting that much is a testament to how lightweight RemOS 2 is and the performance benefits from one of my other projects, <a href='foliclient.github.io'>Foli Client</a>).</p>

        <p>Nothing here yet, but might compile an iso at some point. If for whatever reason you want to go through the trouble of building an iso of this for yourself, check out the build instructions in the <a href='https://github.com/ablazingeboy/rem-os-2#readme'>README</a></p>
